# Occlusion

Occlusion allows mixed reality content in your app to appear hidden or partially obscured behind objects in the physical environment. Without occlusion, geometry in your scene will always render on top of physical objects in your [Passthrough](xref:meta-openxr-camera#passthrough) layer, regardless of their difference in depth.

Refer to the following topics to understand how occlusion works on Meta Quest devices:
