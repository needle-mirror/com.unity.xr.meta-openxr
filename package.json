    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n- Changed the minimum version of the XR Composition Layers dependency from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0, as 2.0.0 is no longer supported.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a possible `NullReferenceException` when installing Unity OpenXR: Meta in a new project. ([MOXRB-151](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/installing-unity-openxr-meta-package-throws-nullreferenceexception-error))\n- Fixed the `MetaOpenXRPassthroughLayer` so that passthrough correctly displays when the app is resumed after being suspended for a system permission dialogue.\n- Fixed `MetaOpenXRPlaneSubsystem` so that it doesn't cause the app to unexpectedly quit if the subsystem is destroyed while hiding planes that don't match your chosen plane detection mode.\n- Fixed the MetaOpenXROcclusionSubsystem so that it destroys all native resources when stopped, reducing its resource consumption while not in use."
