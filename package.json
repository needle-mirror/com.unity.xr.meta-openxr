    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added new extension methods for the `XRDisplaySubsystem` to support getting the supported display refresh rates and requesting a display refresh rate. Refer to [Meta Quest Display Utilities](xref:meta-openxr-display-utilities) for more information.\n\n- Added documentation for recommended settings when using [Universal Render Pipeline](xref:meta-openxr-project-setup#universal-render-pipeline).\n\n### Changed\n\n- Renamed the AR features in the `Meta Quest` OpenXR feature group for brevity and consistency.\n\n- Changed the `ARPlaneFeature` implementation to request the Android permission `com.oculus.permission.USE_SCENE` on Start on OpenXR runtime versions 1.0.31 and newer, as required by the OpenXR specification.\n\n- Changed the `Unity.XR.MetaOpenXR` runtime assembly to only be included on Android and Editor platforms. This was always intended, but previously the assembly had been included on all platforms.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where the `ARAnchorFeature` enabled more OpenXR extensions than were necessary for the `XRAnchorSubsystem` to function correctly."
