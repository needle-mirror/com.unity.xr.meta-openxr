# Features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use any feature in this package, you must enable the corresponding OpenXR Feature in the **Meta Quest** feature group. Otherwise, your app can't access these features. Refer to [Enable OpenXR features](xref:meta-openxr-project-settings#enable-openxr-features) to understand how to enable OpenXR features for the Meta Quest.

> [!TIP]
> If your app doesn't use a feature, it's best practice to disable that feature. In some cases doing so can improve your app's performance.
