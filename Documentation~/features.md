## Provider documentation

The [AR Foundation package documentation](xref:arfoundation-manual) explains each of the AR Features and how to use them. This Meta OpenXR provider documentation is a supplement to AR Foundation, and only includes information regarding APIs where the Meta OpenXR Feature exhibits unique platform-specific behavior.

> [!TIP]
> When developing an AR app, refer to both the AR Foundation package documentation as well as the [required packages](xref:arfoundation-manual#required-packages) for each platform you support.
