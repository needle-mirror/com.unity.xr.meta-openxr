# Meshing

This page is a supplement to the AR Foundation [Meshing](xref:arfoundation-meshing) manual. The following sections only contain information about APIs where Meta Quest exhibits unique platform-specific behavior.

## Space setup

Meshing on Meta Quest devices requires that the user first completes [Space Setup](xref:meta-openxr-device-setup#space-setup) before any mesh data can be used.

> [!Important]
> If Space Setup is not complete, AR Foundation cannot retrieve mesh data from the device.
