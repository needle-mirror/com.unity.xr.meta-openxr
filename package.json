    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added support for saving anchors, loading anchors, and erasing anchors introduced in AR Foundation 6.\n- Added explicit dependencies for the XR Plug-in Management and XR Core Utils packages, which were previously implicit.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed the `MetaOpenXRPlaneSubsystem` to correctly apply the [PlaneClassifications.InvisibleWallFace](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.PlaneClassifications.InvisibleWallFace) semantic label for invisible wall faces.\n- Changed the plane and bounding box subsystems to no longer attempt to request the Android system permission `com.oculus.permission.USE_SCENE` on your app's behalf. To use these features with OpenXR Plug-in version 1.11.0 or newer, your app must request this permission. Refer to [Spatial Data Permission](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-spatial-data-perm/) (Meta Quest Developer Center) to learn how to request this permission.\n- Changed minimum version of AR Foundation dependency from 6.0.0-pre.7 to 6.0.1.\n- Changed minimum Unity Editor version from 2023.3 to 6000.0 as required by AR Foundation 6.0.1.\n- Changed minimum version of OpenXR Plug-in dependency from 1.9.1 to 1.10.0.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where trackable poses would fail to update when the OpenXR runtime returned valid but untracked data.\n- Fixed an issue where planes that should be classified as `WallArt` were classified as `Other`.\n\n### Security"
