# Unity OpenXR: Meta

Unity OpenXR: Meta (Meta OpenXR) enables Meta Quest device support for your AR Foundation projects and provides a C# interface for Meta's OpenXR runtime. This package depends on both [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@6.0) and the [OpenXR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.10).

Unity's [OpenXR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.10) integrates core OpenXR features for all XR platforms. This package integrates Meta-specific vendor extensions to provide additional features for Meta Quest devices. Refer to [Architecture](xref:meta-openxr-architecture) for a full list of OpenXR extensions that this package uses.
