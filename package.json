This is a backwards-compatible change with no effect on your code.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue with [BoundedPlane.nativePtr](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.BoundedPlane.nativePtr), [XRBoundingBox.nativePtr](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRBoundingBox.nativePtr), and [XRAnchor.nativePtr](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRAnchor.nativePtr) so they now return a pointer to a struct with a version number and a pointer to the `XrSpace` handle of their respective trackable type. Refer to [Plane native pointer](xref:meta-openxr-planes#Native-pointer), [Bounding box native pointer](xref:meta-openxr-bounding-boxes#Native-pointer), and [Anchor native pointer](xref:meta-openxr-anchors#Native-pointer) for more information."
